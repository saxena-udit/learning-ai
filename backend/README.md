# Finance Chatbot Backend

This is the backend service for the Finance Chatbot application. It provides API endpoints for chat functionality and financial data processing.

## Architecture

### NSE Data Handling
The NSE (National Stock Exchange) data handling is split into two components for better separation of concerns:

- **`NSEIndexes`** (`app/nse/nse_indexes.py`): Handles raw data fetching, caching, and data processing
- **`NSEFormatter`** (`app/nse/nse_formatter.py`): Handles data formatting, column configuration, and display logic

This separation allows for:
- Clean data handling without formatting concerns
- Reusable formatting logic
- Better maintainability and testing
- Optimized performance with focused responsibilities

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env_my` file with the following variables:
```
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=models/embedding-001
MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-pro
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

## Running the Server

Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Streamlit Application

The application also includes a Streamlit web interface with two main tabs:

### Running the Streamlit App

Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:8501`
